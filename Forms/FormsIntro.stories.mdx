# Forms and Inputs

The most inputs share a common API. Try to keep this as consistent as possible.

## Fully Controlled

The inputs use the "Fully Controlled Components" pattern as described here: https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html  
This makes the inputs simpler: We don't need to handle prop change and state change with `getDerivedStateFromProps` which can easy lead to confusing errors.  

So we need to handle its state somewhere outside.

## Common props

Here are some common props with notable behavior.   

There are more props and some components differ in their props, but they should be self explanatory.

### onChange

- **onChange: PropTypes.func**  
  onChange as we know it, but:

- **changeDelay: PropTypes.number**  
  a delayed onChange, called after a certain timeout. Useful to throttle ajax reqeusts which are coupled to onChange. Cool!

- **onChangeDelayed: PropTypes.func**  
  set a custom timeout 

### Validation
  
- **hideInvalid: PropTypes.bool**  
  Surpress styling and messages of invalid state. E.g. used on inputs inside `CheckCard`.
  
- **onValidChange: PropTypes.func**  
  callback for when the inputs own validation changes, returns `true` or `false`.
  
- **status: PropTypes.oneOf(['invalid', ...?])**  
  Used to set some custom status from outside, currently used to set `invalid`.
  
- **validationMessages: PropTypes.array**  
  Pass down additional, custom invalid messages.

### Etc

- **autofocus: PropTypes.bool**  
  catches focus as soon as input gets mounted
